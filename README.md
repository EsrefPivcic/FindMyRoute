FindMyRoute is a web application designed to simplify the process of searching for bus and train routes between cities. FindMyRoute goes beyond direct connections, offering routes between cities that are not directly linked.

Users can easily input their starting point and destination, and the app will generate the most efficient routes available, taking into account transfers and schedules. Additionally, FindMyRoute allows users to conveniently purchase tickets directly through the app, but they need to register a user account to do so.
